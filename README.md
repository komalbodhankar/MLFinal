# ML Final Project
## Title: Degree of Fairness in Machine Learning Algorithms

### Description:
1. This project is the exploratory analysis of the effect of unfairness in data in Machine Learning Algorithms.
2. We have utilized the "Adult" Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning website for this report.
3. We have shown how "Sex" is considered as a sensitive attribute towards decision making of this project.
4. This project, initially standardizes entire dataset into a categorical form, and later is trained using Fully Feed Forward Neural Network.
5. Our results for this project are stored in below directory for your reference. File name: results.jpeg (created by matplotlib)
